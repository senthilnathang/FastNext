# Custom FastNext Framework settings
# These can be overridden via environment variables in Docker

# Development vs Production
# For production, increase these values:
# shared_buffers = 4GB (for 16GB RAM system)
# effective_cache_size = 12GB (for 16GB RAM system)
# work_mem = 16MB
# maintenance_work_mem = 512MB
# max_connections = 100 (reduce for production with connection pooling)

# Additional optimizations for specific workloads
# For read-heavy workloads:
# effective_cache_size should be higher
# random_page_cost can be lower (1.0 for pure SSD)

# For write-heavy workloads:
# checkpoint_completion_target = 0.8
# wal_buffers = 32MB
# synchronous_commit = off (if data loss is acceptable)
