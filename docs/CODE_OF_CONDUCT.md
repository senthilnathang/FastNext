## Community Guidelines

* **Provide context** when asking questions or reporting issues
* **Be specific** about problems and include relevant details
* **Use appropriate channels** for different types of discussions

### Code Review and Collaboration

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside of project spaces when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When reporting, please include:

* **Names (usernames, real names)** of any individuals involved
* **When and where** the incident occurred
* **Your account** of what occurred
* **Any additional context** you believe is relevant
* **Any available records** (links to posts, screenshots, etc.)

### Response Process

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

**Investigation**: Community leaders will investigate reports promptly and thoroughly. This may involve:
- Gathering additional information from involved parties
- Reviewing public records (posts, comments, etc.)
- Consulting with other community leaders

**Response**: Based on the investigation, community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project leadership with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by a different set of community leaders than those who made the original enforcement decision.
