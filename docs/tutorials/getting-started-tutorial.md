# Getting Started with FastNext Framework

## Video Tutorial Script: "Welcome to FastNext - Your First 10 Minutes"

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
"Welcome to FastNext Framework! In this video, we'll get you up and running in just 10 minutes. Whether you're a developer looking to build modern web applications or a business user wanting to create powerful workflows, FastNext has you covered.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A local FastNext instance running
- Created your first project
- Added some sample data
- Built a simple workflow

Let's dive in!"

### Prerequisites Check (0:30 - 1:00)
"Before we start, make sure you have:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- At least 4GB of RAM available
- Git for cloning the repository

If you don't have these, check the links in the description below."

### Step 1: Clone and Setup (1:00 - 2:30)
"First, let's clone the FastNext repository and get it running locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fastnext.git
cd fastnext
```

Now let's start the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all the necessary services: the backend API, frontend application, PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache.

Let me check that everything is running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see all services with status 'Up'. If any service shows errors, try running `docker-compose logs <service-name>` to see what's wrong."

### Step 2: Access the Application (2:30 - 3:30)
"Once everything is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

You'll see the FastNext login page. Since this is a fresh installation, you'll need to create an admin account.

Click 'Sign Up' and create your account. Make sure to use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication when prompted.

After logging in, you'll see the dashboard. This is your command center for all FastNext activities."

### Step 3: Create Your First Project (3:30 - 5:00)
"Now let's create your first project. Projects in FastNext are containers for your data, workflows, and team collaboration.

Click the 'New Project' button in the top right corner.

Give your project a name like 'My First Project' and add a description. For now, keep it private and select the 'Blank' template.

Click 'Create Project'.

You're now in your project workspace. Let's explore the interface:
- **Overview**: Project summary and key metrics
- **Data**: Where you'll manage your records
- **Team**: Project members and permissions
- **Settings**: Project configuration

Let's add some sample data to see how it works."

### Step 4: Add Sample Data (5:00 - 7:00)
"FastNext uses a flexible data model that lets you create custom record types.

Go to the 'Data' section and click 'Add Record'.

You'll see a form with default fields. Let's add a simple contact record:
- Name: John Doe
- Email: john@example.com
- Phone: +1-555-0123
- Company: Acme Corp

Click 'Save'.

Now let's add a few more records to have some data to work with. You can also import data from CSV files using the 'Import' button.

Notice how FastNext automatically creates views and lists for your data. You can customize these views by adding filters, sorting, and different display options."

### Step 5: Create a Simple Workflow (7:00 - 9:00)
"One of FastNext's powerful features is automated workflows. Let's create a simple workflow that sends a notification when a new contact is added.

Go to Project Settings > Workflows and click 'Create Workflow'.

Name it 'New Contact Notification'.

For the trigger, select 'Record Created' and choose your contact data type.

For the action, select 'Send Email' and configure it to send to the project owner when a new contact is added.

Click 'Save' and activate the workflow.

Now whenever someone adds a new contact, you'll automatically get notified!"

### Step 6: Explore Advanced Features (9:00 - 9:30)
"FastNext has many more features to explore:

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Invite team members and edit documents together
- **API Integration**: Connect with external services
- **Advanced Security**: Zero-trust architecture and compliance features
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
- **Mobile Access**: Responsive design that works on all devices

Check out the documentation for detailed guides on these features."

### Conclusion (9:30 - 10:00)
"Congratulations! You've successfully set up FastNext and created your first project with data and workflows.

Remember:
- Projects organize your work
- Data models define your information structure
- Workflows automate repetitive tasks
- Collaboration features keep teams in sync
